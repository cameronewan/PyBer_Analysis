# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
  The purpose of our analysis was to show how different city types compare to each other based on ride share data for PyBer. Creating a dataframe and a graphical representation for the data will allow for the decision makers at PyBer to make more informed decisions. 
## Results 
  The first observation that we can make about our data is that total fare is largest in Urban areas, followed by Suburban and then Rural.
