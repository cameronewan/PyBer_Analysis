# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
  The purpose of our analysis was to show how different city types compare to each other based on ride share data for PyBer. Creating a dataframe and a graphical representation for the data will allow for the decision makers at PyBer to make more informed decisions. 
## Results 
  The first observation that we can make about our data is that total fare is largest in Urban areas, followed by Suburban and then Rural.
  
  Total rides, drivers, and fares all have Urban being the largest, then Suburban, and finally Rural. However, average fare per driver and average fare per ride is in the reverse order.
