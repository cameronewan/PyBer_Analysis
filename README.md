# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the analysis
  The purpose of our analysis was to show how different city types compare to each other based on ride share data for PyBer. Creating a dataframe and a graphical representation for the data will allow for the decision makers at PyBer to make more informed decisions. 
## Results 
- The first observation that we can make about our data is that total fare is largest in Urban areas, followed by Suburban and then Rural.

- Total rides, drivers, and fares all have Urban being the largest, then Suburban, and finally Rural. However, average fare per driver and average fare per ride is in the reverse order.

## Summary
1. I would suggest that PyBer make a big push to try and obtain more Rural drivers because there are not many of them, but they are the most money for their rides. 
2. You might also consider raising the price of rides by a little bit in Urban areas because just a slight increase in price will earn a lot more money for PyBer.
3. Finally, there seems to be a low amount of rides in Urban areas compared to how many drivers there are. There are almost double as many drivers as there are rides, which is a problem that should be addressed.
